## How to develop on your local machine

First of all, you need an Ecplise IDE. Then use the `git clone` to clone the repository into your local machine (you can use the EGit in Eclipse as well).

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:telluriumLang/tellurium.git
```

Import all Tellurium moudles into Eclipse as Maven project. Open com.telluriumlang.tellurium/src/com/telluriumlang/Tellurium.xtext , then right click and select `Run As` -> `Generate XText Artifacts`. Wait for a minutes and enjoy your development!

Alternatively, you can try to use below commands before you import your project into Eclipse if you don't like to use Eclipse's GUI. :)

```shell
$ cd tellurium
$ mvn clean compile
```

**Hints**

- Please don't always add *.projects files to your commit. Try to exclude them manually.
- Sometimes you may find a small red exclamation mark in one of the projects, please go to the problems and check what happens. (Most of the time, this will be caused by missing src folder or src-gen / xtend-gen folders).
