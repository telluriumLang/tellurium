# Quick Start

Currently provide two types of plugins for Tellurium:

## Eclipse Plugin

Tellurium has an update site for Eclipse.

You can open your Eclipse and find out the `help` menu then select `Install new software...`. Once the dialog window poped up, input our updatesite's url:

[https://telluriumlang.github.io/updatesite/](https://telluriumlang.github.io/updatesite/)

Select the Tellurium Plguin and install it. All dependencies will be automatically fetch from the repositories.

## Visual Studio Code Extension

You can find out a preview version VS Code Extension from our release page. You can manually install the VSIX file into your VS Code environment.

> **Notice**
> 
> The VS Code extension is an PoC (proof of concept) of the language server protocol and may not supports some of the features in Eclipse plugin. We highly recommend you to try out the Eclipse plugin.

## Environment Configuration

You need to install Java 1.8 before using Tellurium. 

If you need to use the browser driver to launch test, please refer to the document in Selenium: [Link](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started_with_webdriver/)
